Graph Creation

The lattice is created using an adjacency matrix, where each node will have as its neighbours the one that,
in a 2D spatial representation, is directly above, under or to its left or right, resulting in a square shaped
graph (usar imagem para explicar). Therefore, we need to check if we can create an edge to the node directly before
it, the one directly after, the two adjacent nodes on the same column but different rows all whilst maintaining a
square pattern. In other words, that if we have a node that represents one of the edges of the overall square, that
it does not connect to a node on the opposite edge.

The random graph is created by randomly generating either a 0 or a 1 for each possible link. If a 1 is generated,
the link is created. This leads to an average degree of N/2, where N is the total number of nodes.



Trust game:

In order to create a more diverse social setting in order to more accurately portray modern society, we used 8 different
kinds of personalities:

-A personality that, after starting with cooperation, always plays the same move as the opponent's last.

-A personality that always cheats.

-A personality that always cooperates.

-A personality that cooperates until cheated, after which this personality will always cheat.

-A personality that starts with a pattern and then proceeds to always cheat if it was never cheated or copy the last move if it was cheated.

-A personality that is the same as the first one, except it will only cheat if cheated twice or more times in a row.

-A personality that starts with cooperate, then keeps the same move if cooperated back and changes its move if cheated.

-A personality that always does a random move.

This not only dampens the spread of pure defectors but it also bears greater semblance to modern society.
